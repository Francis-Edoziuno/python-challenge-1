# Module 2 Challenge
Interactive ordering system from a food truck created using Python.

For this project, several distinct lessons was combined to develop a working food truck ordering system. Every piece of information required to complete this project is contained in the file menu.py located in the python-challenge-1 repository. 
 
It was really challenging, and I had to spend a lot of time revisiting previous lessons, asking other students for help, watching YouTube videos on various python lessons, search and reading repos on when I reached a brick wall. I found that utilizing YouTube videos was helpful. I was then able to go back and comprehend the relationships between the variables on a deeper level and concretize the lessons.

I'm aware that going forward, I must focus more on the logic flow and structure of my codes when using tabs. I was troubleshooting the incorrect part of my code for a long time.

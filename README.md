# Module 2 Challenge
Interactive ordering system from a food truck created using Python.

For this project, several distinct lessons were combined to develop a working food truck ordering system. Every piece of information required to complete this project is contained in the file menu.py located in the python-challenge-1 repository. 
 
It was really challenging, and I had to spend a lot of time revisiting previous lessons, asking other students for help, watching YouTube videos on various Python lessons, and searching and reading repositories, as well as asking expert learning assistant when I reached a brick wall. I found that utilizing YouTube videos was helpful. I could then comprehend the relationships between the variables on a deeper level and concretize the lessons.

I'm aware that as we advance, I must focus more on the logic flow and structure of my codes when using tabs. I was troubleshooting the incorrect part of my code for a long time.
